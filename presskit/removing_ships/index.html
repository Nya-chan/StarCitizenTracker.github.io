              <h2 id="description">(Re)moving All Ships - 2018.10.03</h2>
              <p></p>
              
              
              
              <p>As part of our ongoing optimization process, the StarCitizen Tracker team has decided to make some changes to the main page layout. These changes are intended to improve the readability of the main page and reduce extraneous information.</p>
              <p>Whereas StarCitizen Tracker is primarily concerned with an accurate and concise overview of gameplay expectations, information regarding the completion of simple assets will be displayed less prominently starting today.</p>
              <p>The first and primary change will be to move information regarding ships off the main page and onto starcitizentracker.github.io/ships. Other assets may follow in due course such as planetary systems. Information regarding ships and their playable status is often better served by several other great fansites in any case. starcitizen.tools/Category:Ships stands out in our mind.</p>
              <p>With regards to these changes, careful consideration is being taken in cases where assets have specific features related to it. For example, if certain ships are closely linked to in-game features (such as &quot;Data transportation&quot; or &quot;Refuelling&quot;) then those features will be listed on the main page individually so as not to affect the ease of use and completeness.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>A reminder, StarCitizen Tracker is a crowdsourced project so if you spot any errors or have a suggestion, please submit them. We do get regular messages when new ships are introduced or become flyable, but unfortunately, feedback regarding new features and updated elements has been less forthcoming. Your assistance in this matter will allow us to continually improve and refine the site experience and is greatly appreciated.</p>

              <h2 id="features">Contributing Factors</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Overabundance of reports on ship status changes and new ships</li>
                <li>Lack of community feedback and source links for gameplay elements</li>
                <li>Many ships are official stretch goals which prevent removal entirely</li>

            In 2012, Chris Roberts went to Kickstarter to pitch his space simulation game &quot;Star Citizen&quot; with a Wing Commander style single player mode entitled &quot;Squadron 42&quot;.
          
            Much has been promised to backers over the course of the last 6 years. Expectations for the titles are stratospheric, bordering on outlandish; with Chris himself setting the tone.
          
            Star Citizen Tracker is a good faith attempt to catalog public claims and commitments made by Cloud Imperium Games Corporation. It is a crowdsourced endeavor intended to be useful and constructive for both fans and developers. It exists in the absence of similar resources because the need is indeed great.
