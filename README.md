# StarCitizen Tracker

StarCitizen Tracker is forked from [TrumpTracker](https://trumptracker.github.io/) but derives most of it's inspiration from a list entitled ["Where's the NMS we were sold on?"](https://web.archive.org/web/20160816191001/https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/4y046e/wheres_the_nms_we_were_sold_on_heres_a_big_list/)

You can read even more about this project and it's history at [starcitizentracker.github.io/presskit/](https://starcitizentracker.github.io/presskit/)
